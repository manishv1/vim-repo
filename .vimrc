"After visually selecting a block of lines (for example, by pressing V then moving the cursor down)
" press Alt-j to move the whole block down, or press Alt-k to move the block up.

"The command :m .+1 (which can be abbreviated to :m+) moves the current line to after line number .+1 (current line number + 1). That is, the current line is moved down one line.
"The command :m .-2 (which can be abbreviated to :m-2) moves the current line to after line number .-2 (current line number âˆ’ 2). That is, the current line is moved up one line.
"After visually selecting some lines, entering :m '>+1 moves the selected lines to after line number '>+1 (one line after the last selected line; '> is a mark assigned by Vim to identify the selection end). That is, the block of selected lines is moved down one line.
"The == re-indents the line to suit its new position. For the visual-mode mappings, gv reselects the last visual block and = re-indents that block.
